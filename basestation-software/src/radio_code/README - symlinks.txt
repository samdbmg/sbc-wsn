Note that some of these files are shared with the node software and must therefore be symlinked in, the mklink command achieves this on Windows.

From node-software/src/radio_code the following files are required:
radio_config.h
radio_control.c
radio_control.h
radio_schedule_settings.h
radio_shared_types.h
